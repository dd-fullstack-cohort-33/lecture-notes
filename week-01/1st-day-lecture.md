## Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp: let's break it down
- Developer
  - Question: What does it mean to be a developer?
  - A person who writes applications in computer code.
  - This is you!  Right now!  You belong here.
  - Attributes
    - Tenacity
    - Teamwork
    - Empathy
  - Developer is not the only career path coming out of this bootcamp, just the most common
    - project manager
    - technical recruiter
    - designer
    - UI/UX specialist
    - business analyst
- Web - Writing for the browser.
  - Question: Which devices run browsers?
    - Laptops/desktops
    - Phones
    -Tablets
    - Screen readers
    - Cars
    - APIs
    - More
- Fullstack - Facile with both front-end and back-end development
  - https://twitter.com/bluecoders/status/966624401172123649
  - **front-end** - how the page looks and behaves
    - HTML, CSS, JavaScript and related technologies
    - Not the same as a designer!
  - **back-end** - transforming data between human-readable and machine-readable formats 
    - **Database** - where our data is stored
    - back-end language (PHP, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, many others)
- Bootcamp - 10 week intensive course
  - Expect homework
    - Almost 2/3 of our students report doing more than 10 hours per week outside of class.
    - Last three weeks are especially intense
  - We treat this like a professional environment, not a classroom
    - Accountability: first you, then peers, then instructors.
    - No personal attacks, rudeness, mocking, condescension, or other toxic interpersonal behavior.
  - Bring your whole self
    - Mental, emotional, and physical.
    - Transparency!  If we know what's going on, we can help.
    - Attendance and participation is mandatory - 50% of capstone

## Classroom logistics
- Some terms we sometimes use
  - **clam shells down**: close laptops/ lower monitors.
  - **TL;DR**: too long; didn't read.
  - **re-hi all**: Class is starting again.
- Zoom intro
  - breakout rooms
  - chat
  - we don't usually pay attention to nonverbal responses
    - don't use "raise hand", speak up instead  
- Stand-up meetings: 15 minute meetings 8:00 a.m.
  - What you did (including tech work/events outside of class)
  - What you're going to do next
- Snap challenges
  - short one-hour assignments designed to use and build beyond what you learned
  - not like regular quizzes -- you aren't always going to get the answer!
  - really good analog to what you often do as a professional developer
